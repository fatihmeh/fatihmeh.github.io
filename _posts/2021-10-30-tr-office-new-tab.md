There is an easy way to achieve this, [Office RibbonX Editor](https://github.com/fernandreu/office-ribbonx-editor) edits file attributes to create various new options. I pushed a pull request for Turkish translation, which soon will be integrated with the program I hope.

[With custom images](https://gitlab.com/fatihmehmetozcan/practice-files-pages/-/tree/master/source/excel/excel-5_custom-images-ribbon)


Another example is, you can edit Excel add-in files (.xlam) and add them as add-in via 'Developer' tab to see your custom tab on every workbook.
