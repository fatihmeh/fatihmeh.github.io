<h1 class="parag-header">Hi, I am Fatih!</h1>
<p class="about">I am a computer-aided design (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design" target="_blank">CAD</a>) specialist with programmer skills and an aircraft maintenance planning coordinator. I have managed to become a SolidWorks <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/299bb037-063a-4071-bd22-4425362f5d5e/public_url" target="_blank">Champion</a> and a Certified SolidWorks Expert (<a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/714364cf-6316-4259-a887-f85d9bb7d731/public_url" target="_blank">CSWE</a>).</p>

<p class="about">My professional years started in 2009 as a 3D designer and drafter at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_plant" target="_blank">concrete batching plant</a> manufacturer. Continued at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_masts_and_towers#Tubular_steel" target="_blank">telecommunication tower</a> manufacturer. After that, leaned towards aviation to work with a <a href="https://www.easa.europa.eu/domains/aircraft-products/design-organisations" target="_blank">design organization</a> that creates various types of projects for flying vehicles. Since 2019 January I had the title of an aircraft maintenance planning coordinator that lasted up to 2024 July. Currently working as an aircraft modification designer for a Part 21.J design organisation. </p>
