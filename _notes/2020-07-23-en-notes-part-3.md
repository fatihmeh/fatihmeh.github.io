###  Why Some People Get Sicker Than Others


COVID-19 is proving to be a disease of the immune system. This could, in theory, be controlled.


[https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-immune-response/610228/](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-immune-response/610228/){:target="_blank"}


This degree of uncertainty has less to do with the virus itself than how our bodies respond to it. As Murphy puts it, when doctors see this sort of variation in disease severity, “that’s not the virus; that’s the host.” Since the beginning of the pandemic, people around the world have heard the message that older and chronically ill people are most likely to die from COVID-19. But that is far from a complete picture of who is at risk of life-threatening disease. Understanding exactly how and why some people get so sick while others feel almost nothing will be the key to treatment.


**One of the common, perplexing experiences of COVID-19 is the loss of smell—and, then, taste. “Eating pizza was like eating cardboard,”**


[Though SARS-CoV-2 (the new coronavirus) isn’t reported to invade the brain and spine directly, its predecessor SARS-CoV seems to have that capacity.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322928/){:target="_blank"} **If nerve cells are spared by the new virus, they would be among the few that are. When the coronavirus attaches to cells, it hooks on and breaks through, then starts to replicate. It does so especially well in the cells of the nasopharynx and down into the lungs, but is also known to act on the cells of the liver, bowels, and heart. The virus spreads around the body for days or weeks in a sort of stealth mode, taking over host cells while evading the immune response.** It can take a week or two for the body to fully recognize the extent to which it has been overwhelmed. At this point, its reaction is often not calm and measured. The immune system goes into a hyperreactive state, pulling all available alarms to mobilize the body’s defense mechanisms. This is when people suddenly crash.

###  Istanbul Death Toll Hints Turkey Is Hiding a Wider Coronavirus Calamity


April 20, 2020


[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/world/middleeast/coronavirus-turkey-deaths.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/world/middleeast/coronavirus-turkey-deaths.html){:target="_blank"}


Still, deaths in Istanbul during the five-week period between March 9 and April 12 were about 30 percent higher than historical averages, The Times has found.


The health minister announced that 601 health personnel had been infected with the virus by April 1. But Dr. Adiyaman said that nearly 1,500 have been infected, including 1,000 in Istanbul. Seventeen health professionals have died from the virus in Istanbul, according to reports released by several trade unions.

###  Koronavirüs vefat sayıları ne anlatıyor?


April 18, 2020


[https://www.onuraltindag.info/pt-tr/posts/excess_mortality/](https://www.onuraltindag.info/pt-tr/posts/excess_mortality/){:target="_blank"}


[Türk Tabipler Birliği, Turkiye’deki raporlamada klinik bulguları koronavirüsü işaret eden ama PCR testi negatif çıkan hastaların vefatı halinde, vefat nedeninin koronavirüs olarak kayıt edilmediğini açıkladı.](https://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/ttb-saglik-bakanligi-kovid-19-olumlerini-dunya-saglik-orgutu-kodlarina-gore-raporlamiyor-1731938){:target="_blank"}


Basit bir tahmin ile 12 Mart-11 Nisan tarihleri arasında İstanbul’daki vefat sayılarının normalde gerçekleşmesi beklenenden 2,158 kişi [%95 güven aralığı: 1,976-2,340] fazla olduğunu söylemek mümkün.
Resmi rakamlara göre 12 Mart-11 Nisan tarihleri arasında tüm ülkede 1,006 kişiyi koronavirüs nedeniyle kaybettik. Aynı zaman diliminde yalnız İstanbul’da hesapladığım beklenenin üstündeki vefat sayısı bu rakamın iki katı.

### Tracking covid-19 excess deaths across countries

April 16, 2020


In many places, official daily figures exclude anybody who did not die in hospital or who did not test positive. Often the cause of death takes several days to establish, which creates a lag in the data.
